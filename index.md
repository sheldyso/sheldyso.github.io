### About me

For my degree, I am currently studying BSc Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University Of Gloucestershire.

## Level 4

At level 4, I had 8 Assignments in 4 modules spread across 2 semesters.

## Introduction to AI

### Semester 1 - Training a Fastai Convolutional Neural Network

In this module, I used a rock, paper, scissors image dataset and created mutiple CNN learners to explore different methods of improving the accuracy of the predictions. This was done in a Jupyter notebook using google colaboratory for the training. This was also paired with SciKit-image.
The completed notebook can be viewed [here](https://github.com/sheldyso/Rock-Paper-Scissors-CNN).

### Semester 2 - SciKit-Learn data insights and visualisation

## Systems design and development

### Semester 1 - Business Report

For this assignment, I had to create a business report on a project that would utilise a given dataset which was a customer personality analysis dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).
